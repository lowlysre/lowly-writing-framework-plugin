# Docs & code comments

Loaded from `SKILL.md` when writing or editing a README, wiki, module doc, or code comment.

These describe the system **as it is now**. The history (why it changed, what it used to do, what issue prompted it) belongs in the PR body or commit message, never in the file.

- Present tense, declarative: "This function retries on transient errors," not "was updated to retry"
- No narrative or migration breadcrumbs: "used to own", "previously handled", "was removed", "no longer", "a scan found X", "as of #123". If it's not true today, delete it instead of explaining what changed
- Reference an issue/PR number in an inline code comment for exactly two reasons: an external upstream bug (`workaround for dotnet/runtime#12345`), or a `TODO` written as a posterity note, aimed at a future reader once this project's current context, the team, the phase, the tracking issue itself, is likely gone or forgotten. A fast-follow or anything already slotted as next-up work doesn't qualify, that's planned work still inside the current context, not archaeology for later: describe the current behavior and let the backlog carry the plan. Never cite an in-flight or already-merged PR/issue from this repo, that's the "as of #123" breadcrumb above: delete it and describe current behavior instead. The same goes for a near-term issue in another repo: the comment goes stale once it lands
- An inline code comment covers only the non-obvious: the *why* behind a non-intuitive choice, a gotcha, a workaround for someone else's bug. Don't restate what the code already says, that's what a docstring or README is for
- One comment per non-obvious thing, not one per line. A well-named variable or function is the comment; `// increment counter` above `counter++` isn't a candidate for a shorter comment, it's a candidate for no comment
- Don't repeat what's already said one layer over: if the docstring covers the parameters, an inline comment restating them above the call site is the same fact twice; if the README covers the module's purpose, a header comment re-explaining it is the same fact twice. State it once, in the place a reader of that layer would look
- Match the file's existing form (docstring format, comment marker and placement, wrapping), never its wording or content. An existing comment that breaks the rules in this file (history, issue refs, restating the code, the length cap) isn't precedent: fix it when you touch it
- When a change removes or replaces what a comment describes, rewrite the comment to the new current behavior, or delete it if the code now explains itself. Drop its tracking-issue refs instead of swapping in new ones, unless one qualifies under the upstream-bug rule above
- Hard cap: 4 lines per inline comment, and most fit in 1-2. A comment that's still running past 4 lines isn't documenting one non-obvious thing anymore, it's carrying an explanation the code should carry instead: split the logic into a well-named helper, shorten the comment, or move the detail into a docstring/README where longer explanation belongs
- Honest about limitations inline where relevant: "doesn't handle X yet" beats silence or a context-free TODO
- In a README/wiki (GitHub renders it as markdown), a gotcha or limitation worth flagging can use `> [!NOTE]`/`> [!WARNING]`/`> [!IMPORTANT]` instead of a `Note:`/`Warning:` prefix line. Reserve it for something worth stopping the reader, most limitations still read fine as a plain sentence. Code comments aren't rendered markdown, GitHub admonitions don't apply there, plain text prefixes if any
